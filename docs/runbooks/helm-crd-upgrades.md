# Helm Chart Upgrades with CRD Changes

## Background

Helm (and by extension Flux) never updates CRDs automatically on `helm upgrade`. CRDs are only installed on `helm install`. This is an intentional Helm safety boundary: CRDs are schema definitions for live cluster resources, and updating them incorrectly could corrupt data.

When a Helm chart ships updated CRDs (common on major and some minor version bumps), they must be applied manually **before or alongside** merging the Renovate PR that bumps the chart version.

Flux's `crds: CreateReplace` option on a `HelmRelease` can automate this, but CRD updates are irreversible — Flux cannot roll them back if something goes wrong. The manual approach is retained here intentionally so that upgrades with breaking CRD changes require explicit review.

## General process

1. **Read the chart's upgrade guide** before merging any Renovate PR for a major or minor version bump.
2. **Identify CRD changes** — look for a migration guide, CHANGELOG entry, or `crds/` directory diff between the old and new chart version.
3. **Apply updated CRDs** using server-side apply (safer than client-side for CRDs):
   ```bash
   kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f <crd-url-or-file>
   ```
   - `--server-side`: the API server computes the merge, which is more correct for complex schemas.
   - `--force-conflicts`: overwrites fields owned by another manager (e.g. a previous `kubectl apply` or Flux), preventing the update from being blocked by field ownership conflicts.
4. **Merge the Renovate PR** — Flux reconciles the `HelmRelease` and runs the equivalent of `helm upgrade` automatically. You do not need to run `helm` commands directly.

## Breaking changes to check beyond CRDs

Not all breaking changes are CRD-related. Also check the chart's changelog for:
- **Values restructuring** — fields moved, renamed, or re-nested under new keys (requires updating `values:` in the `HelmRelease`)
- **Provider or feature renames** — keys that silently have no effect if not updated
